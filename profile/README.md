## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Elven.js is a compact browser library for interacting with the [MultiversX](https://multiversx.com/) blockchain and smart contracts.  
Elven.js is a simplified JS SDK wrapper. No build steps are required. You can also use it directly from CDN.

**Important:** The tool is still under active development. There will be breaking changes till version 1.0. To be sure what is and what still needs to be implemented, check the [kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/elven-js/projects/1).
